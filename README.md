# Term-Papers-and-Notes
Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

This repository is a treasure trove of my term paper reports and other goodies I created during my coursework at IISERM.

Oh, and if you happen to notice a missing file, don't fret! You can find the one missing here: [https://github.com/xxxTermPaper](https://github.com/dev-aditya/Neutrino-Mass-Models-PHY655-TermPaper).

I hope you find these resources helpful, whether you're a fellow student seeking knowledge or simply me revisiting my past work.
Happy learning! ðŸ“š
